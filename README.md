Building an Access-Controlled Network with Cisco Packet Tracer

Introduction:
With the advancement of technology, networks continue to play a pivotal role in both the business world and our homes. In this project, I learned how to create and manage an access-controlled network using Cisco Packet Tracer. In this blog post, I will describe the project's core objectives and how it was successfully executed.

Project Description:
The project aimed to interconnect two separate networks using two Cisco routers. Three computers on the first router, two computers, and one server on the second router constituted the network. The primary goal was to allow the computers on the first router to access only the server on the second router while preventing them from seeing other devices.

Step 1: Building the Network Topology
Using Cisco Packet Tracer, the project began by constructing the network topology. Connections between the two routers and the computers attached to each router were considered. The physical and logical configuration of the network was defined at this stage.

Step 2: IP Address Assignments
Each device required appropriate IP addresses to be assigned. IP addresses for the computers on the first router and the server on the second router were chosen and configured. Additionally, gateway addresses were correctly set.

Step 3: Creating an Access Control List (ACL)
An access-controlled list (ACL) was crafted to ensure that only the computers on the first router could access the server on the second router. This ACL permitted access solely to the server's IP address while blocking other traffic.

Step 4: Applying the ACL
The created ACL was applied to the LAN interface of the first router. This enabled access control, ensuring that only the computers behind the first router were affected, and unwanted traffic was blocked.

Results:
The project was successfully completed, resulting in an access-controlled network. Computers on the first router could only access the server on the second router while remaining oblivious to other traffic. This achievement holds significant importance for network security and access control.

Conclusion:
This project provided an excellent opportunity to learn the fundamental steps of creating an access-controlled network using Cisco Packet Tracer. It also underscored the value of understanding network configuration and management. I plan to further enhance these foundational skills in future projects.
